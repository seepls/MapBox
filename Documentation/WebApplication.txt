distinguish Mapbox GL JS from other map libraries
web apps using Mapbox GL JS, maps are rendered dynamically by 
combining vector tiles with style rules using JavaScript and WebGL.
 Rendering maps in the browser rather than on a server makes it possible to change 
 the map's style and the data it displays dynamically and in response to user interaction.

 in the simplestyle specification or by using the built-in setStyle method.
