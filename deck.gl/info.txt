framework for visual exploratory data analysis of large datasets

deck.gl is a great match with React, supporting efficient WebGL rendering under the Reactive programming paradigm.
And when used with Mapbox GL it automatically coordinates with the Mapbox camera system to provide 
compelling 2D and 3D visualizations on top of your Mapbox based maps.

git clone git@github.com:uber/deck.gl.git

yarn start

If the example uses a mapbox base map you need a Mapbox access token
export MapboxAccessToken={Your Token Here} && yarn start

yarn run start-local
