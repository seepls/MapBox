framework for visual exploratory data analysis of large datasets

deck.gl is a great match with React, supporting efficient WebGL rendering under the Reactive programming paradigm.
And when used with Mapbox GL it automatically coordinates with the Mapbox camera system to provide 
compelling 2D and 3D visualizations on top of your Mapbox based maps.
